Access Modifiers 
-----------
1. Public- all the classes
2. Private- only that specific class
3. Protected- all the classes of that package and all the subclassses outside the scope of that current package
4. Default- all the classes in that package
* outer most class level only public/default( not private / protected)
* there is no default keyword as access modifier(it is just a terminology for default/package scope)
* always check the class scope before the members
* compile with -d . to create custom package
* import statement can only import the current package classes(not of sub package)
* protected scope members are directly accessed by sub/child classes without creating  instances

-----
1. Private and protected class are not there only public or default classes can be initialized
---------------
Packages

1. import p1.*
    - it will only import classes of that package not the classes of the sub packages 

--------------------
-cannot import protected variable from the package through reference variable 

-----------
a class cannot be declared as static
static class- that have all the members as static
eg- MATH,INTEGER,SYSTEM (they have all the lines and methods as static)
